Project's Purpose or Goal: Have fun doodling and share it.

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

React 
Firebase
HTML Canvas
If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

Add RGB or other filter effects in the DoodleDetail page - maybe connect to an interactive chart.
Add more tools - fractal generators, color themes.
Add experience points and levels to unlock more doodle tools.
Add games - dodging bombs, projectiles, etc. as you doodle.
What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

Chart.js interactivity.
Possibly call a color theme generator API.
More complex Database structures in Firebase.
Possibly React Router and Redux for learning purposes (probably not absolutely necessary for the small scale of my app or these features specifically).
Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

I've been working on this since Thursday after group project presentations and have a working React app for just the basic doodle functions here: https://github.com/nathanfletch/doodle. Scroll down to edit parameters (radius, etc.)

This is a refactor of the initial vanilla JS prototype I implemented here: https://github.com/nathanfletch/simple-doodle. (Make sure to hit ctrl as you doodle)
